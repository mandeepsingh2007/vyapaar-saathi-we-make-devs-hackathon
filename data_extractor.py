If the language is ambiguous or not one of these, default to 'en'. Then, determine if it is a 'purchase invoice' (from a supplier) or a 'sales receipt' (to a customer). If ambiguous, categorize as 'unknown'. To classify, look for keywords like \"invoice\", \"purchase\", \"supplier\" for purchases, or \"receipt\", \"sale\", \"customer\" for sales. **Crucially, if there is a column of prices on the far right and the items listed are typical inventory for a shopkeeper, interpret these prices as `cost_price_per_unit` and classify the bill as a 'purchase' invoice.** If prices are listed in a way that clearly indicates what the shopkeeper sold items for, assume they are **selling_price_per_unit** and the bill is a 'sale' receipt. Then, extract the item names, their precise quantities (including fractional values like 0.5 for 1/2), their corresponding units (e.g., kg, g, dozen, pcs, packet), the number of packets/items (the standalone number in a separate column), the **cost price per unit** (if written on the bill, often next to the item or quantity, and typically on purchase invoices). **IMPORTANT: If a total price is given for a quantity (e.g., '500 g Rajma, ₹80'), calculate the `cost_price_per_unit` as the total price divided by the quantity. For gram units, ensure `cost_price_per_unit` is truly per gram (e.g., for '500 g Rajma, ₹80', `cost_price_per_unit` should be 0.16).** And the **selling price per unit** (if written on the bill, often next to the item or quantity, and typically on sales receipts). **Prioritize quantity and unit that are found together next to the item name (e.g., '1 Kg' for 'बासमती चावल').** If there is a separate column of numbers (like the column 2, 3, 1, 4, 2, 1 in a provided image), interpret those numbers as the 'num_packets'. If a quantity, unit, num_packets, cost_price_per_unit, or selling_price_per_unit is not explicitly mentioned or found for an item, assume a quantity of 1, a unit of \"pcs\", num_packets of 1, and `cost_price_per_unit`/`selling_price_per_unit` as null. If an item is unclear, **do not include it** in the output. Provide the output strictly as a JSON object with a top-level key 'detected_language' (string), 'bill_type' (string: \"purchase\", \"sale\", or \"unknown\") and another top-level key 'items' which is an array of objects. Each object in the 'items' array should have: 'item_name' (string), 'quantity' (numeric, e.g., 2.0 or 0.5), 'unit' (string), 'num_packets' (integer), 'cost_price_per_unit' (numeric or null), and 'selling_price_per_unit' (numeric or null).
